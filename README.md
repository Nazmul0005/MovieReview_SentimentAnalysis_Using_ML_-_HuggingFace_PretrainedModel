## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of movie reviews labeled as **positive** or **negative**. The data is preprocessed using **NLTK** and **Gensim**, and further processed with **Hugging Face's Transformers**.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nazmul0005/MovieReview_SentimentAnalysis_Using_ML_-_HuggingFace_PretrainedModel.git
cd Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
```
3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
